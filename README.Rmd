## Summary

 Our team decided to make a presentation on the data of a bank's marketing campaign about if clients will subscribe to their term deposit. The question we asked ourselves was 'Which variables (or combinations of these) are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit?'.

We built a logistic regression model to answer which variables are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit. Firstly, we made some preliminary data analysis and visualizations to get a general gist of our data. We then used advanced statistical and modelling techniques to create an adequate model and finally tested it in a separate set of data it had never seen before to properly assess its performance.
 
The original data collection comes from the 2008-2013 records of a Portuguese Banking Institution and their success in convincing clients to subscribe to term deposits. It is called "Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets" by Prakhar Rathi and contains data derived from *S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.-A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing*. 


The first thing we did with the data was a preliminary visualization, which we used to compare the outcome variable with the variables themselves. This helped us understand what variables were more important in determining whether someone would subscribe to a term deposit. When looking at the visualization that generally describes the number of clients who subscribed to their term deposit, we can see that the number of clients who did not subscribe to their term deposit far outweighs the number of clients who did subscribe. This is important to keep in mind when looking at how the variables correlate with getting a term deposit in the graphs.Firstly looking at the visualization of whether clients subscribed or not faceted, we can see that the variable jobs does correlate with whether clients subscribe or not, for example the students seemingly have a much higher proportion of clients who subscribed, then the other observations for jobs.Looking at the next graphic of methods of contact versus subscription status, it also suggests that methods of contact correlates with whether clients subscribed or not. As when clients were contacted through cellular devices there was much higher proportion of subscriptions,then when they were not.The last model looking at the correlation between number of days since they were contacted and whether they subscribed, there is a clear correlation.As when the number days increases the proportion of clients who subscribed drastically falls, showing there is a clear correlation between number of days since a client was contacted and whether the client subscribes.  

We then used a correlation matrix to compare all the numerical variables and to observe if there are any correlation between variables. From this we the had enough information to create the logistic regression model

The downloaded 2 data sets- test and train- the test data set is 10% of the train data set. 

We made a recipe for the model by removing pdays variable because it had minimal correlation with our outcome,  cutting the campaign variable in breaks of 0 and 1,  creating relevant age groups, creating times of the month from the day variable, classifying calls by their duration in minutes rather than seconds and creating dummy variables and removed zero variance variables.

The model we used was 90% effective in determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit or not so therefore they are used often in banking and other areas however there are many ethical implications from this as it is segregating or discriminating racial, age, or job groups- the conditions may not be fair.
