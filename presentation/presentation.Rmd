Which variables (or combinations of these) are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit? Can we use these to build a predictive model? 

# Our Methodology

We built a logistic regression model to answer which variables are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit. Firstly, we made some preliminary data analysis and visualizations to get a general gist of our data. We then used advanced statistical and modelling techniques to create an adequate model and finally tested it in a separate set of data it had never seen before to properly assess its performance.

# Our Dataset

The original data collection comes from the 2008-2013 records of a Portuguese Banking Institution and their success in convincing clients to subscribe to term deposits. It is called "Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets" by Prakhar Rathi and contains data derived from *S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.-A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing*. 

# The General Picture

The results of the marketing campaign are as follows:


```{r campaign_success, out.width="70%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking_train %>%
  mutate(y=fct_recode(y, Subscribed= "yes", 
        `Didn't Subscribe` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                              "Didn't Subscribe"="#d91a1a")) +
   labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Effectiveness of Marketing Campaign",
  )
```

Could the client's jobs have had an impact on whether they subscribed to term deposits?


```{r job_impact, out.width="85%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }

mutate(

Which numerical variables have the the strongest correlation? Is there some collinearity perhaps?

<font size = '6'>**Correlation between numerical predictors**</font>
```{r correlation_matrix, out.width="80%", fig.align = "centre", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
cor <-banking_train %>%
  mutate(Outcome = if_else(y == "yes", 1, 0)) %>%
  summarize(age, balance, day, duration, campaign, pdays, previous,Outcome) %>%
cor(method = "pearson")

corrplot(cor,type = "lower", bg = "#e8e8e8", method = c("number"), order = "original", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)

```

# Our model plan 


# How we split our data
```{r modify_df, echo = FALSE}
banking_train <- banking_train %>%
  mutate(y = factor(if_else(y == "yes", 1, 0))) #Changed Outcome Variable to Factor Type
```

```{r split_csv, echo = TRUE}

set.seed(45221)

#80-20 Split of Data

banking_split <- initial_split(banking_train, prop = 0.8)
reduced_train_df <-training(banking_split)
reduced_test_df <-testing(banking_split)
```
Number of Rows in Sub-Train Dataframe:
```{r display_subclass1, echo = FALSE}
nrow(reduced_train_df)
```
Number of Rows in Sub-Test Dataframe:
```{r display_subclass2, echo = FALSE}
nrow(reduced_test_df)

# Conclusion


# Ethics

However, even after all this analysis and correlation, each person's ethics can affect the results in a way that is unpredictable.

. . . 

- Loyalty; If the client is loyal to their bank and another bank tries to make him subscribe to a term deposit, it may be that he rejects only because of his loyalty towards his bank.

. . . 

- Trustworthiness; If the client doesn't know about the bank and how well it does normally, he decides not to trust it despite was he is being told.
