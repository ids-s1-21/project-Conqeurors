Which variables (or combinations of these) are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit? 

# Our Methodology

We built a logistic regression model to answer which variables are the most important indicators when determining wether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit via phone. Firstly we made a huge grid to determine which variables have the strongest correlation with the output variable and after that we fittet a linear regression on these variables. (Will complete after we finish the presentation)

# Our Dataset

The original data collection comes from the 2008-2013 records of a Portuguese Banking Institution and their success in convincing clients to subscribe to term deposits. It is called "Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets" by Prakhar Rathi and contains data derived from *S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.-A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing*. 

# The general picture

The general outcome of the company's campaign to get clients to subscribe to term deposits.

. . .

```{r campaign_success, out.width="70%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking %>%
  mutate(y=fct_recode(y, Subscribed= "yes", 
        `Not Subscribed` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                              "Not Subscribed"="#d91a1a")) +
   labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Number of clients that subscribed to a term deposit",
  )
```

Could the client's jobs have an impact on whether they subscribe to term deposits?

. . .

```{r job_impact, out.width="900%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking %>%
mutate(
  job= fct_recode(job, Administrative = "admin.",
                  Management = "management", 
                  Entrepreneur= "entrepreneur",
                  `Blue Collar` = "blue-collar", 
                  Housemaid = "housemaid", 
                  Technician = "technician" , 
                  Services = "services", 
                  Student = "student" , 
                  `Self Employed`= "self-employed", 
                  Unemployed = "unemployed", 
                  Unknown= "unknown", 
                  Retred = "retired" ),
  y=fct_recode(y, Subscribed= "yes", 
               `Not Subscribed` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                               "Not Subscribed"="#d91a1a")) +

- Our workflow 

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

# Images


# Final Test


# Conclusion


# Ethics

However, even after all this analysis and correlation, each person's ethics can affect the results in a way that is unpredictable.

. . . 

- Loyalty; If the client is loyal to their bank and another bank tries to make him subscribe to a term deposit, it may be that he rejects only because of his loyalty towards his bank.

. . . 

- Trustworthiness; If the client doesn't know about the bank and how well it does normally, he decides not to trust it despite was he is being told.
