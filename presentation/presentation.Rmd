## Which variables (or combinations of these) are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit? {data-background-image="img/random.png"}


# Our Methodology

We built a logistic regression model to answer which variables are the most important indicators when determining wether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit via phone. Firstly we made a huge grid to determine which variables have the strongest correlation with the output variable and after that we fittet a linear regression on these variables. (Will complete after we finish the presentation)

# Our Dataset

The original data collection comes from the 2008-2013 records of a Portuguese Banking Institution and their success in convincing clients to subscribe to term deposits. It is called "Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets" by Prakhar Rathi and contains data derived from *S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.-A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing*. 

# The general picture

The general outcome of the company's campaign to get clients to subscribe to term deposits.
```{r campaign_success, out.width="80%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking %>%
  mutate(y=fct_recode(y, Subscribed= "yes", 
        `Not Subscribed` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                              "Not Subscribed"="#d91a1a")) +
   labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Number of clients that subscribed to a term deposit",
  )
```

When presenting, you use the left/right arrows to step through the top-level (horizontal) slides. When you arrive at a vertical stack you can optionally press the up/down arrows to view the vertical slides or skip past them by pressing the right arrow.

## reveal.js

- The presentation is created using the `reveal.js` package

- You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the # and ## heading tags

- You can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (----)

----

- You can also add pauses between content on a slide using (". . .")

. . .

Like this.

...or using "::: fragment"

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

<div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">or text in two columns</div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">like this</div>
</div>

because you can combine HTML and Markdown syntax.

<p style="font-size: 8pt; position: absolute; bottom: -5em; width: 100%; text-align: center;">*You can also add footnotes</p>

# Code

```{r boring-regression}
# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
:::: column
* Some text
* goes here
::::

:::: column
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Different widths

::: columns
:::: {.column width="40%"}
* Some text

::::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535448033526-c0e85c9e6968?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs (\$...\$), e.g. $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
