Which variables (or combinations of these) are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit? Can we use these to build a predictive model? 

# Our Methodology {data-background-image="img/Theme.png"}


<font size='6'>

We built a logistic regression model to answer which variables are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit. Firstly, we made some preliminary data analysis and visualizations to get a general gist of our data. We then used advanced statistical and modelling techniques to create an adequate model and finally tested it in a separate set of data it had never seen before to properly assess its performance.</font>

# Our Dataset {data-background-image="img/Theme.png"}

<font size='6'>

The original data collection comes from the 2008-2013 records of a Portuguese Banking Institution and their success in convincing clients to subscribe to term deposits. It is called "Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets" by Prakhar Rathi and contains data derived from *S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.-A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing*. </font>

```

# The General Picture {data-background-image="img/Theme.png"}

The results of the marketing campaign are as follows:


```{r campaign_success, out.width="70%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking_train %>%
  mutate(y=fct_recode(y, Subscribed= "yes", 
        `Didn't Subscribe` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                              "Didn't Subscribe"="#d91a1a")) +
   labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Effectiveness of Marketing Campaign",
  )
```

Could the client's jobs have had an impact on whether they subscribed to term deposits?


```{r job_impact, out.width="85%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }

    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Number of clients that subscribed to a term deposit",
    subtitle= "Faceted by jobs"
  )
```

----

Could the client's duration of their last contact have had an impact on whether they subscribed to term deposits?

```{r visualization_duration,echo = FALSE }
banking_train %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=y, color=y))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  geom_jitter()+
 labs(
    x = "Duration of last contact",
    y = "Clients subscribed",
    title = "Relationship between duration of last contact 
    with the bank and whether a client subscribes to a term deposit") 
```

----

Is there a connection between the clients decision and what month of the year it is?

```{r visualization_month, echo = FALSE}
banking_train %>%
  mutate(
    month = fct_relevel(month, "jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"),
 y = fct_recode(y, Subscribed = "yes", 
               `Didn't Subscribe` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=month,fill=y))+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                               "Didn't Subscribe"="#d91a1a")) +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "Clients Contacted",
    title = "Relationship between time of the year and subscriptions",
    fill = "Outcome"
  ) 
```

----

Is there a correlation between how the client was contacted and if they subscribed to the term deposit?

```{r visualization_contact,echo = FALSE }
banking_train %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = contact, y = y, color = contact))+
  geom_jitter()+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    x = "Methods of contact",
    y = "Clients subscribed?",
    title = "Relationship between contact method and subscriptions",
  ) 
```

----

Do the number of days since the client has been contacted matter?

```{r visualization_pdays,echo = FALSE }
banking_train%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pdays, y = y)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "#2c9af5") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    y = "Outcome",
    x = "Days",
    title = "Relationship between the number of days since a client was 
    contacted and whether they subscribed"
  ) 
```

Which numerical variables have the the strongest correlation? Is there some collinearity perhaps?

# Our Recipe {data-background-image="img/Theme.png"}
<font size = '6'>The recipe we used for this particular model can be observed below:</font>

<font size = '5'>

1. We removed the pdays variable because it had minimal correlation with our outcome.

2. We cut the campaign variable in breaks of 0 and 1.

3. We created relevant age groups.

4. We created times of the month from the day variable.

5. We classified calls by their duration in minutes rather than seconds.

6. We created dummy variables and removed zero variance variables.

# Conclusion {data-background-image="img/Theme.png"}

<font size = '6'>As discovered by our preliminary analysis and logistic regression, we observed that call duration, month of the year and past campaign outcome were the most relevant predictors to our outcome variable. In addition, we managed to build a model which predicted with 90% certainty whether or not a client would subscribe to a term deposit. In fact, our model was much better at predicting whether a client would not subscribe. </font>

# Ethics {data-background-image="img/Theme.png"}

<font size = '6'>Models like the one we created are constantly used by financial institutions to predict future client behavior. </font>

----

<font size = '7'> Though effective, the ethics of this must be observed...</font>

. . . 

<font size = '6'>- Is it correct to leave possible customers out of the possibility of subscribing to a term deposit because they happen to have the wrong job?</font>

. . . 

<font size = '6'>- Perhaps their balance is too low?</font>

. . .

<font size = '6'>-Or maybe they didn't graduate from highschool?</font>
