Which variables (or combinations of these) are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit? Can we use these to build a predictive model? 

# Our Methodology

We built a logistic regression model to answer which variables are the most important indicators when determining whether an individual will subscribe to a term deposit. Firstly, we made some preliminary data analysis and visualizations to get a general gist of our data. We then used advanced statistical and modelling techniques to create an adequate model and finally tested it in a separate set of data it had never seen before to properly assess its performance.

# Our Dataset

The original data collection comes from the 2008-2013 records of a Portuguese Banking Institution and their success in convincing clients to subscribe to term deposits. It is called "Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets" by Prakhar Rathi and contains data derived from *S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.-A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing*. 

# The General Picture

The results of the marketing campaign are as follows:


```{r campaign_success, out.width="70%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking_train %>%
  mutate(y=fct_recode(y, Subscribed= "yes", 
        `Didn't Subscribe` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                              "Didn't Subscribe"="#d91a1a")) +
   labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Effectiveness of Marketing Campaign",
  )
```

Could the client's jobs have had an impact on whether they subscribed to term deposits?

. . .

```{r job_impact, out.width="90%", fig.width=6, echo = FALSE }
banking_train %>%
mutate(
  job= fct_recode(job, Administrative = "admin.",
                  Management = "management", 
                  Entrepreneur = "entrepreneur",
                  `Blue Collar` = "blue-collar", 
                  Housemaid = "housemaid", 
                  Technician = "technician" , 
                  Services = "services", 
                  Student = "student" , 
                  `Self Employed`= "self-employed", 
                  Unemployed = "unemployed", 
                  Unknown= "unknown", 
                  Retred = "retired" ),
  y = fct_recode(y, Subscribed = "yes", 
               `Didn't Subscribe` = "no")) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = y,fill= y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Subscribed"="#3b9e37", 
                               "Didn't Subscribe"="#d91a1a")) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
    ) +
  facet_wrap(.~job, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,

# Ethics

However, even after all this analysis and correlation, each person's ethics can affect the results in a way that is unpredictable.

. . . 

- Loyalty; If the client is loyal to their bank and another bank tries to make him subscribe to a term deposit, it may be that he rejects only because of his loyalty towards his bank.

. . . 

- Trustworthiness; If the client doesn't know about the bank and how well it does normally, he decides not to trust it despite was he is being told.
